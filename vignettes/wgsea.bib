  abstract = {Combined analyses of gene networks and DNA sequence variation can
	provide new insights into the aetiology of common diseases that may
	not be apparent from genome-wide association studies alone. Recent
	advances in rat genomics are facilitating systems-genetics approaches.
	Here we report the use of integrated genome-wide approaches across
	seven rat tissues to identify gene networks and the loci underlying
	their regulation. We defined an interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7)-driven
	inflammatory network (IDIN) enriched for viral response genes, which
	represents a molecular biomarker for macrophages and which was regulated
	in multiple tissues by a locus on rat chromosome 15q25. We show that
	Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 2 (Ebi2, also known as Gpr183), which
	lies at this locus and controls B lymphocyte migration, is expressed
	in macrophages and regulates the IDIN. The human orthologous locus
	on chromosome 13q32 controlled the human equivalent of the IDIN,
	which was conserved in monocytes. IDIN genes were more likely to
	associate with susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (T1D)-a macrophage-associated
	autoimmune disease-than randomly selected immune response genes (P
	= 8.85?×?10(-6)). The human locus controlling the IDIN was associated
	with the risk of T1D at single nucleotide polymorphism rs9585056
	(P = 7.0?×?10(-10); odds ratio, 1.15), which was one of five single
	nucleotide polymorphisms in this region associated with EBI2 (GPR183)
	expression. These data implicate IRF7 network genes and their regulatory
	locus in the pathogenesis of T1D.},

  abstract = {Among the many applications of microarray technology, one of the most
	popular is the identification of genes that are differentially expressed
	in two conditions. A common statistical approach is to quantify the
	interest of each gene with a p-value, adjust these p-values for multiple
	comparisons, choose an appropriate cut-off, and create a list of
	candidate genes. This approach has been criticised for ignoring biological
	knowledge regarding how genes work together. Recently a series of
	methods, that do incorporate biological knowledge, have been proposed.
	However, the most popular method, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA),
	seems overly complicated. Furthermore, GSEA is based on a statistical
	test known for its lack of sensitivity. In this article we compare
	the performance of a simple alternative to GSEA. We find that this
	simple solution clearly outperforms GSEA. We demonstrate this with
	eight different microarray datasets.},
